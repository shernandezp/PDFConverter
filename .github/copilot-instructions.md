# Copilot Instructions

## Sensitive Data Rules

- Never include test file names or test file content details in commit messages, changelogs, comments, or any public-facing text.
- Test documents (e.g., DOCX, XLSX templates) are sensitive — do not reference their names or describe their contents.

## General Rules

- Do not use Python for scripting or tooling tasks; use PowerShell or .NET instead.
